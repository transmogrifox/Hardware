Have some power converter boards on hand using a TI TPS40195 for a point-of-load application:
http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/slus720f/slus720f.pdf

It occurred to me I could convert this into a Class D audio amplifier with a few modificatios to the board.

There is very little explanatory information here, so it's not a project easily digestible for the general public,
but I decided to keep the repository public since somebody might find some inspiration and utility with this.

For a new design it would probably be more attractive to use purpose-built audio amplifier IC's, but this project is
a good way to repurpose boards that would otherwise go into the scrap bin.
