Derivations supporting a novel approach to expressing the frequency domain transfer function of a peak current control switch-mode converter.  This method deviates from the construct of the averaged-switch model (ASM) first credited to Vatche Vorperian.

In this derivation strategy,
1) The peak current control signal is sampled with an impulse train (Zero-order-hold), then re-sampled at time coincident to the valley currents. It is observed that the inverse transfer function of a ZOH sampler must be applied to correct the characteristic high frequency attenuation.
2) The transfer function relating control current (trip threshold) to valley currents is expressed as difference equation (discrete-time IIR filter).
3) The transfer function relating valley currents to average input (charge cycle) and output (discharge cycle) currents is expressed as a discrete time FIR filter.
4) It is observed the FIR filter is non-LTI. Small-signal analysis is applied to the nonlinear function to arrive at a first-order discrete-time FIR filter response.
5) The sequence of impulses generated by convolution of control current with valley current and average current transfer functions is reconstructed interpreting the ramp + box waveform as an impulse response. The impulse response shape is characteristic to the inductor charge and discharge current waveforms.
